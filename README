Introduction
=============
This is a basic xpressnet arduino implementation.
My goal was to create my own switch remote controller, so it implements only wht I was looking for, but it is very easy to add features.

Arduino Mega
============
You need an Arduino Mega 2560. Why? because xpressnet is a 9bit serial protocol. Standard Arduino SDK don't provide 9bits. But someone reimplement a 9bit Serial library.
So you need to take HardwareSerial.h and HardwareSerial.cpp and replace these in the Arduino SDK (in /hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/)

Wiring
======
You will need a Max485cpa chip, and pay attention to the wiring image provided. I'm a bit confused on the RJ12 where is the GND and where is the VCC.

Code
====
When everything is in place, you can use the code. Mine currently is used to switch every 2 seconds a turnout (its id on my lockmauss is 38, and in the code, it is 37, because human counts from 1.. and computer begins to count from 0)


Hope it can help!
