Introduction
=============
This is a basic xpressnet arduino implementation.
My goal was to create my own switch remote controller, so it implements only what I was looking for, but it is very easy to add features.
There is video (in french) of what I'm trying to do at http://youtu.be/JcD7iC3VbOw

Arduino Mega
============
You need an Arduino Mega 2560. Why? because xpressnet is a 9bit serial protocol. Standard Arduino SDK don't provide 9bits. But someone reimplement a 9bit Serial library.
So you need to take HardwareSerial.h and HardwareSerial.cpp and replace these in the Arduino SDK (in /hardware/arduino/avr/cores/arduino/)

Wiring
======
You will need a Max485cpa chip, and pay attention to the wiring image provided. I'm a bit confused on the RJ12 where is the GND and where is the VCC.

Code
====
When everything is in place, you can use the code. Mine currently is used to switch every 2 seconds a turnout (its id on my lockmauss is 38, and in the code, it is 37, because human counts from 1.. and computer begins to count from 0)
The "architecture" is the following:
- decodeXpressnet will read on a serial device data coming from xpressnet (via rs485), and will use decodeStage2 to decode data payload.
- if it is a "normal inquiry" message, poolEvent() will be called.
- poolEvent will check the XpressCommand stack state. If there is something, it will pop up one XpressCommand from the stack and send it.
- in your other part of the code, when you want to emit a command, you need to
 * create it: XpressCommand c = new XpressCommand()
 * populate it : c->pushData(0x21); c->pushData(0x81);
 * put it on the queue: XpressCommand::pushStackCommand(stack,c);



Hope it can help!
